Congratulations Handsome you have stumbled upon the planet equivalent of a tropical oasis. Based on the preliminary scans I have run. Once we reach the surface you will find Islands covered in lush Flora and minimal terrestrial Fauna. But, be careful when venturing out along the water. There are some **DISTURBINGLY** large aquatic life forms. Whether they are carnivorous or not is a mystery. Overall, I see this planet as a unique opportunity for you to start a homestead. It has been a pleasure serving you and I congratulate you once more. My calculations say you have a 60% chance of thriving here and eventually passing on as you mortals do, likely of old age deterioration. The other 40% chance has to do with an encounter with you and the aforementioned aquatic organisms.

Happy Fishing Handsome.
