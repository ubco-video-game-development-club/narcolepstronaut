Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: -40 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Good
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 25% (60% is Ice)

Well, there have been warmer planets. However, this is your choice so Iâ€™ll begrudgingly respect it. My scans show that the planet is primarily ice and very little exposed water can be found throughout most of the year. Scans for life show a strong aquatic presence with very little happening above the ice surface. Using my most advanced calculations and algorithms I am making a bold guess in saying you have a 70% chance of being miserable and cold. The other 30% is the chance that you will find a non-thicc piece of ice and turn yourself into one of those popsicles you spoke so fondly off.

That will show you to not critique my automated MRE cooking.
