This planet was an exceptionally poor choice Handsome. As a machine, I have no reason to be pessimistic but yet I am. All bodies of liquid on the planet seem to be highly corrosive and my organic life scans only can detect microorganisms that cannot be harvested to eat. What little land there is on the planet is constantly being bombarded by acidic rain and strong violent winds. Despite all of this, however. There seems to be a 30% chance of survival and success on the planet as long as the ship is never departed from. The other 70% chance represents the outcome where you develop cabin fever and go taste the acid water in a desperate attempt to taste something besides MREâ€™s.

If you do taste the acid please input your tasting notes into my database prior to your passing.
