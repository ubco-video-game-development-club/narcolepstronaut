Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: 0 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Mediocre (Meh)
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 30% 

The air is manageable in small dosages but you will need to intermittently put your helmet back on or return to the ship. Every time you come back and forth between the ship and the planet’s surface I am programmed to make awful jokes about “Not seeing you in forever.” My calculations say the bit will get old after 4 repetitions. Organisms are primarily aquatic and seem to be relatively small in size similar to phytoplankton on Earth. With an educated guess one can assume they are the primary contributors to the planet’s atmosphere being somewhat tolerable. As long as they can photosynthesize like their earthly counterparts. My calculations say there is a 99.9999 % chance you will carry on and continue to eat MRE’s while enjoying waterfront views. However, there is a 0.0001% chance you’ll develop baleen like a whale.

The second option could take a while.
