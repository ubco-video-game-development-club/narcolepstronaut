Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: 20 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Good (Enough)
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 50% 

Handsome, this planet we have stumbled upon is as mediocre as the oatmeal you have had to eat since the day we left Earth. There is almost no variation in biomes on the terrestrial surface and the other 50% of the planetâ€™s surface consists of the ocean with fairly consistent depths and weather. All organisms seem to be reasonably sized when compared to my references from Earth. Not sure what else to say Handsome, the planet might be described as boring by some but beauty lies within your eye, as you are the beholder. My final analysis says there is a 99.7% chance you will be content with your life on this planet but truly a husk looking for more. The other 0.3% opportunity says you will trip getting out of the ship and hit your head, passing away shortly after.

Maybe Keep your space Helmet on while you walk out.
