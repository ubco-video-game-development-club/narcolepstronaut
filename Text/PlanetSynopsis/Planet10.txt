Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: -2 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Good
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 78%

This planet is covered in a lush and stunning forest where it seems as if most water travels below the planet’s crust to the roots underneath. The rest of the water is store in two large bodies of water at both polls. The fauna on the planet oddly enough seems to be found primarily underground. Also, I made a note of how much heat was coming off the trees. It seems rather high when in comparison to other flora in my database. This leads me to believe that the trees may have carnivorous fruit similar to the pitcher plants of the earth. Maybe this lends its hand to why the rest of the organisms remain subterranean.

Maybe if you and the trees don’t hit it off the mole people will.
