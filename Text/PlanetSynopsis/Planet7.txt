Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: 16 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Mediocre (Bring an inhaler)
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 66% 

It seems as if we stumbled upon this planet at an inopportune time. Based on my calculations and the predictions based on these calculations. This planet just had a catastrophic climate-related event and we are witnessing the tail end of a continent-wide fire. I would predict that this planet’s atmosphere and air quality will dramatically increase in the months to come but until then you better be keeping your helmet on for extended walks along the planet’s surface. Flora and fauna have also been ravaged by the events that transpired, however, there is some beauty in the mystery of what will come from such cataclysm. My calculations say there is a 50% chance life will come back with newfound youth and colour and the planet will experience a fresh beginning. The alternative 50% chance says the planet will be unable to bounce back and you will die alone/ with me (not an animate being).

Not a very fun coin flip tbh :/
