Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: 55 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Poor (Lacklustre is an understatement)
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 90%

Well, Handsome you really did it this time. You managed to select a planet that seems to be in a perpetual volcanic eruption. I track no life forms larger than your beloved coffee pot and I can only assume they sustain themselves by eating others of their kind. When I and you launched in the Yuri-Valentina all that time ago they launched fireworks in celebration. But on this planet, there is an 80% chance these fireworks will be the end of your mortal life. However, if we manage to land and find an LZ accommodating enough for you to explore the surface there is a 20% chance you will eat and eventually assume deity status over the coffee pot monsters I mentioned earlier.

Better hope you end up playing God before you meet God.
