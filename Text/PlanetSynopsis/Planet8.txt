Planet Synopsis:

Temperature: 23 Degrees Celsius
Air Quality: Good (Calculations say it is **Omega Crisp**)
Terrestrial Surface Coverage: 50% (ish) 

Handsome check this out, this planet has rings. There’s a joke in there about you being alone in space with no SO but I figured I would let that lie… So besides your inexorable solitude, something to note about this planet is how amazing its air quality seems to be. Based on my scans this amazing air probably has to do with the flora on the planet. Most of the ground is wetland so it both water and ground. I understand this because I am a supercomputer with all worldly knowledge. But you are just a human. I would explain it to you but I cannot be bothered so you will have to learn on the job. My calculations say there is a 50% chance you’ll only believe the ground is water. The other 50% chance you only understand the ground is ground. There is a 0% chance you understand the concept of wetlands.

In this I and my supercomputer brain are certain.
