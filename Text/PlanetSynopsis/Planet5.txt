Handsome this isn’t even a planet. You managed to select a passing comet and assumed it was a planet. As an AI incapable of true genuine human surprise, I am dumbfounded you didn’t notice earlier. You are a heavily trained and well-respected scientist, engineer and pilot. So how did you manage to be so wrong?

Have fun on this glorified ice cube dipstick.
