  message: "Hello \u201CHandsome.\u201D\r\n\r\nI am the spectre of death and I must
    say you have been one of my favourite investments to pursue. You are the only
    human I have dealt with who has travelled as far and wide as you have. The universe
    is a big place and despite the fact you only explored a fraction of it, you are
    streets ahead of the rest of your comrades back on Earth. It is a shame however
    that after all the amazing feats you accomplished. Your own curiosity and lack
    of self-control lead to your ultimate demise. You could have been trampled by
    an alien inconceivable to most people\u2019s minds or swatted out of existence
    by a smattering of beautiful but deadly comets. But instead, you poked a frayed
    wire one too many times. A real shame that is.\r\n\r\nIt is funny though, so
    there is that.\r"
