  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: 0 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Mediocre (Meh)\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage: 30% \r\n\r\nThe air is manageable
    in small dosages but you will need to intermittently put your helmet back on
    or return to the ship. Every time you come back and forth between the ship and
    the planet\u2019s surface I am programmed to make awful jokes about \u201CNot
    seeing you in forever.\u201D My calculations say the bit will get old after 4
    repetitions. Organisms are primarily aquatic and seem to be relatively small
    in size similar to phytoplankton on Earth. With an educated guess one can assume
    they are the primary contributors to the planet\u2019s atmosphere being somewhat
    tolerable. As long as they can photosynthesize like their earthly counterparts.
    My calculations say there is a 99.9999 % chance you will carry on and continue
    to eat MRE\u2019s while enjoying waterfront views. However, there is a 0.0001%
    chance you\u2019ll develop baleen like a whale.\r\n\r\nThe second option could
    take a while."
