  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: -40 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Good\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage: 25% (60% is Ice)\r\n\r\nWell, there have
    been warmer planets. However, this is your choice so I\u2019ll begrudgingly respect
    it. My scans show that the planet is primarily ice and very little exposed water
    can be found throughout most of the year. Scans for life show a strong aquatic
    presence with very little happening above the ice surface. Using my most advanced
    calculations and algorithms I am making a bold guess in saying you have a 70%
    chance of being miserable and cold. The other 30% is the chance that you will
    find a non-thicc piece of ice and turn yourself into one of those popsicles you
    spoke so fondly off.\r\n\r\nThat will show you to not critique my automated MRE
    cooking."
