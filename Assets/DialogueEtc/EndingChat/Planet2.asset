  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: 16 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Mediocre (Bring an inhaler)\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage: 66% \r\n\r\nIt seems
    as if we stumbled upon this planet at an inopportune time. Based on my calculations
    and the predictions based on these calculations. This planet just had a catastrophic
    climate-related event and we are witnessing the tail end of a continent-wide
    fire. I would predict that this planet\u2019s atmosphere and air quality will
    dramatically increase in the months to come but until then you better be keeping
    your helmet on for extended walks along the planet\u2019s surface. Flora and
    fauna have also been ravaged by the events that transpired, however, there is
    some beauty in the mystery of what will come from such cataclysm. My calculations
    say there is a 50% chance life will come back with newfound youth and colour
    and the planet will experience a fresh beginning. The alternative 50% chance
    says the planet will be unable to bounce back and you will die alone/ with me
    (not an animate being).\r\n\r\nNot a very fun coin flip tbh :/."
