  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: -2 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Good\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage: 78%\r\n\r\nThis planet is covered in a
    lush and stunning forest where it seems as if most water travels below the planet\u2019s
    crust to the roots underneath. The rest of the water is store in two large bodies
    of water at both polls. The fauna on the planet oddly enough seems to be found
    primarily underground. Also, I made a note of how much heat was coming off the
    trees. It seems rather high when in comparison to other flora in my database.
    This leads me to believe that the trees may have carnivorous fruit similar to
    the pitcher plants of the earth. Maybe this lends its hand to why the rest of
    the organisms remain subterranean.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you and the trees don\u2019t
    hit it off, you and the mole people will."
