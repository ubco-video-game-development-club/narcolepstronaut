  message: "It seems I have dozed off yet again. \r\n\r\nLAI-KA will be upset whenever
    I wake up. And sure, maybe I will miss some breathtaking planets while resting
    here. But, who is to say the best has already passed. The universe is ever-expanding
    and accelerating. So with the Yuri Valentina travelling at a constant rate. I
    sure do have a lot more universe explore. While I sleep and while I awake the
    space engulfing my ship will continue to amaze and continue to strike awe. So
    I might as well enjoy my rest while the opportunity is provided. Because only
    a greater power knows the energy I\u2019ll need when I finally land on one of
    those beautiful and mysterious worlds.\r\n\r\nThat being said I\u2019m going
    to stop dreaming now\u2026...\r"
