  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: 23 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Good (Calculations say it is **Omega Crisp**)\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage:
    50% (ish) \r\n\r\nHandsome check this out, this planet has rings. There\u2019s
    a joke in there about you being alone in space with no SO but I figured I would
    let that lie\u2026 So besides your inexorable solitude, something to note about
    this planet is how amazing its air quality seems to be. Based on my scans this
    amazing air probably has to do with the flora on the planet. Most of the ground
    is wetland so it both water and ground. I understand this because I am a supercomputer
    with all worldly knowledge. But you are just a human. I would explain it to you
    but I cannot be bothered so you will have to learn on the job. My calculations
    say there is a 50% chance you\u2019ll only believe the ground is water. The other
    50% chance you only understand the ground is ground. There is a 0% chance you
    understand the concept of wetlands.\r\n\r\nIn this I and my supercomputer brain
    are certain."
