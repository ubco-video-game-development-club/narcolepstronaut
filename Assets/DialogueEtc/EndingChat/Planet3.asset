  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: 32 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Moderate (You\u2019ll live)\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage: 10% (Hope you know
    how to swim)\r\n\r\nCongratulations Handsome you have stumbled upon the planet
    equivalent of a tropical oasis. Based on the preliminary scans I have run. Once
    we reach the surface you will find Islands covered in lush Flora and minimal
    terrestrial Fauna. But, be careful when venturing out along the water. There
    are some **DISTURBINGLY** large aquatic life forms. Whether they are carnivorous
    or not is a mystery. Overall, I see this planet as a unique opportunity for you
    to start a homestead. It has been a pleasure serving you and I congratulate you
    once more. My calculations say you have a 60% chance of thriving here and eventually
    passing on as you mortals do, likely of old age deterioration. The other 40%
    chance has to do with an encounter with you and the aforementioned aquatic organisms.\r\n\r\nHappy
    fishing handsome."
