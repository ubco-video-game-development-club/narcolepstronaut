  message: "Planet Synopsis:\r\n\r\nTemperature: 20 Degrees Celsius\r\nAir Quality:
    Good (Enough)\r\nTerrestrial Surface Coverage: 50% \r\n\r\nHandsome, this planet
    we have stumbled upon is as mediocre as the oatmeal you have had to eat since
    the day we left Earth. There is almost no variation in biomes on the terrestrial
    surface and the other 50% of the planet\u2019s surface consists of the ocean
    with fairly consistent depths and weather. All organisms seem to be reasonably
    sized when compared to my references from Earth. Not sure what else to say Handsome,
    the planet might be described as boring by some but beauty lies within your eye,
    as you are the beholder. My final analysis says there is a 99.7% chance you will
    be content with your life on this planet but truly a husk looking for more. The
    other 0.3% opportunity says you will trip getting out of the ship and hit your
    head, passing away shortly after.\r\n\r\nMaybe keep your space helmet on while
    you walk out."
