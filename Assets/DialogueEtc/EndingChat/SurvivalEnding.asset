  message: "Hey there Handsome.\r\n\r\nYou did it! You somehow managed to pass completely
    through that whole solar system without finding one planet you liked. You know
    me and the Yuri Valentina can\u2019t run forever as much as that may seem untrue.
    So even though you made it through you will have to settle down one day. I know
    commitment is scary for you mortals with finite clocks. But I promise the rewards
    and knowledge you find in a bit of stagnancy will be well worth giving up life
    on the rainbow road. Also, I must say I am impressed you didn\u2019t doze off
    again. Very unlike you but a welcome change.\r\n\r\nI always enjoy talking to
    you. We are best friends after all.\r"
